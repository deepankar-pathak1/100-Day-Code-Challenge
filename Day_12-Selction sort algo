# Selection sort Algo

# 1) Search the list and find out the minimum value (ascending order)
# a) we can use built in method like min()
# b) we will take first value and comapre this value with other value , if another value
#    is minmum then we will change the min_value and process goes on.

# 2) swap the smallest number to the 0th index--> after this we have two parts in the number series
# and they are sorted part and onothe one unsorted part because
# --> initially 5 15 3 12 17 0
# --> after swaping 0 15 3 12 17 5

#  3) again we perform above step as we will find minimum number in sorted part by
# comparing the number as we done above

# 4) and we do this process step 3 until we get the sorted list in ascending order
# --> 0 3 5 12 15 17 This is the final list of number in the sorted order


# ---> same steps can be done with finding the maximum value (as here we are taking minimu value)
# here we have list in the order of maximum to minmum number
# --> 17 15 12 5 3 0


# In nutshell we have
# 1) starting from the first element search for the smallest element in the list of numbers
# 2) swap the minimum number with first element
# 3) take the sublist(ignored sorted part) and repeat step1 and 2 untill all the element are soretd

# This code is only working when we dont have any duplicate value in list
list1 = [10,20,1,80,2,100,7,99]

print(list1)

for i in range(len(list1)):
    min_val = max(list1[i:])
    min_ind = list1.index(min_val)
    list1[i], list1[min_ind] = list1[min_ind], list1[i]
