--- Deep Copy 
Deep copy is a process in which the copying process occurs recursively.
It means that any changes made to a copy of object do not reflect in the original object. In python, this is implemented using “deepcopy()” function.



# Python code to demonstrate copy operations 

  
# importing "copy" for copy operations 

import copy 

  
# initializing list 1 

li1 = [1, 2, [3,5], 4] 

  
# using deepcopy to deep copy  

li2 = copy.deepcopy(li1) 


--- Shallow Copy 
A shallow copy means constructing a new collection object and then populating it with references to the child objects found in the original
. It means that any changes made to a copy of object do reflect in the original object. In python, this is implemented using “copy()” function.

li2 = copy.copy(li1)
