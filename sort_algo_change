# Selection sort Algo

# 1) Search the list and find out the minimum value (ascending order)
# a) we can use built in method like min()
# b) we will take first value and comapre this value with other value , if another value
#    is minmum then we will change the min_value and process goes on.

# 2) swap the smallest number to the 0th index--> after this we have two parts in the number series
# and they are sorted part and onothe one unsorted part because
# --> initially 5 15 3 12 17 0
# --> after swaping 0 15 3 12 17 5

#  3) again we perform above step as we will find minimum number in sorted part by
# comparing the number as we done above

# 4) and we do this process step 3 until we get the sorted list in ascending order
# --> 0 3 5 12 15 17 This is the final list of number in the sorted order


# ---> same steps can be done with finding the maximum value (as here we are taking minimu value)
# here we have list in the order of maximum to minmum number
# --> 17 15 12 5 3 0


# In nutshell we have
# 1) starting from the first element search for the smallest element in the list of numbers
# 2) swap the minimum number with first element
# 3) take the sublist(ignored sorted part) and repeat step1 and 2 untill all the element are soretd

# This code is only working when we dont have any duplicate value in list

# list1 = [56,3,2,3,15,1,10] # here we have repeated value
# print(list1)
#
# for i in range(len(list1)):
#     min_val = min(list1[i:])
#     min_ind = list1.index(min_val,i)
#     list1[i], list1[min_ind] = list1[min_ind], list1[i]
#
#
# print(list1)

l1 = [10,8,100,50,9,5,9]
print("Unsorted : ",l1)
for i in range(len(l1)):
    min_value = min(l1[i:])
    min_index = l1.index(min_value,i)
    l1[i], l1[min_index] = l1[min_index], l1[i]
print("sorted : ",l1)



Unsorted :  [10, 8, 100, 50, 9, 5, 9]
sorted :  [5, 8, 9, 9, 10, 50, 100]



-------------------------



l1 = [10,8,100,50,9,5,9]
# Some changes to sort algo is that
# --> we are doing 6 iteration but we need only 5 iteration
# --> and secondly we if element in list[i] is same list[min_ind] then we dont need to do swaping?

print("Unsorted List", l1)
for i in range(len(l1)):
    min_value = min(l1[i:])
    min_index = l1.index(min_value,i)
    if l1[i] != l1[min_index]:
        l1[i],l1[min_index] = l1[min_index], l1[i]
print("Sorted List : ",l1)
